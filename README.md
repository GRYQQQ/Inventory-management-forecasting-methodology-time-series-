The report begins analysis of the superstore dataset by conducting some preparation, including converting the data into a time series within R, as well as decomposing and smoothing the data. The report then applies a variety of forecasting methods, including mean, naive, seasonal naive, and random walk forecasts. More advanced forecasting methods such as linear regression, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and recursive neural networks (RNN) were also leveraged. Each forecasting method is then compared and ranked based on the error metrics of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Moreover, qualitative analysis of each forecasting method is done to assess how it handles outliers such as supply shocks, aligns with historical knowledge, and adds value to the business case. Finally, a conclusion can be drawn as to which forecasting model would be ideal in assessing future demand for retail locations based on accuracy.
